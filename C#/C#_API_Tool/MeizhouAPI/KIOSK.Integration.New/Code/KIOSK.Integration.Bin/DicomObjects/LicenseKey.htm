        <h2><a name="Background">Background</a></h2>
        <p><font size="3">When a control such as the DicomViewer
        control is created in most environments, it can be either
        in &quot;design&quot; or &quot;user&quot; mode, depending
        on whether the environment is a development or end-user
        system. The DicomObjects licensing model uses this
        difference to allow unlimited use by developers, but to
        limit the ability of end-users to modify their systems.
        Three modes of operation are supported:</font></p>
        <ol>
            <li><font size="3">The trial version of DicomObjects has
                no license file, and use in either
                &quot;design&quot; or &quot;user&quot; modes is
                subject only to the 60 day limit on any machine.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3">Those who have obtained developer
                or &quot;end-user&quot; licences for DicomObjects
                are given a full unrestricted version of the
                DicomObjects.ocx file, and also a license file
                called DicomObjects.lic. When present in the same
                directory as DicomObjects.ocx, this allows use of
                the full version in &quot;design&quot; mode. When
                compiled version of the applications are
                produced, these include in various ways (specific
                to the development environment) the information
                in the license file.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3">Such applications may be run <strong>without
                </strong>the<strong> </strong>license file, and
                indeed this file must not be distributed with
                applications, other than with the specific
                permission of Medical Connections.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="3">Note that many environments can use a
        license file or embedded license information
        interchangeably, and correct operation on a machine with
        the license file does not guarantee correct operation on
        machines without this file, so it is important to disable
        this file (e.g. by renaming it) before distributing
        applications to end-users.</font></p>
        <h2><a name="Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a></h2>
        <p><font size="3">No changes are required for development
        use other than copying the OCX files and LIC files into
        the same directory, and ensuring that the OCX is
        registered.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Applications must then simply be
        recompiled to EXE files, and the new OCX and EXE used
        together.</font></p>
        <h2><a name="MSVC">MSVC</a></h2>
        <p><font size="3">If creating DicomViewer objects
        &quot;on-the-fly&quot; as in the DicomObjects example,
        then the license string
        _bstr_t(&quot;5A6B243015C61143&quot;) must be added
        manually as the 8th parameter to the to the Create
        function.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If using ClassWizard to create
        DicomViewer objects in a dialog box, then the easiest way
        is simply to remove the viewer and re-add it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In either case, the application must of
        course then be recompiled.</font></p>
          <h2><a name="Borland">Borland Delphi &amp; CPP Builder</a></h2>
          <p>When importing ActiveX controls, Borland environments store the
          license information in the imported files and packages.&nbsp; This
          therefore needs to be updated, but unfortunately not all version of
          these environments use the same formats.</p>
        <p>In general, you should re-import your support packages once you have
        installed and re-registered the OCX and LIC files as above, as they will
        then incorporate the license information.&nbsp; If you have problems
        with this, please contact <a href="mailto:support@medicalconnections.co.uk">Medical
        Connections</a> for assistance.</p>
        <h2><a name="Microsoft Access">Microsoft Access</a></h2>
        <p>This environment does not support the concept of user
        mode, and the .lic file is always therefore necessary.
        Please contact medical Connections for permission to
        redistribute the .lic file.</p>
        <h2><a name="Web Applications">Web Applications</a></h2>
        <p>The licensing model for controls allows the licensing
        information to be included in a &quot;license pack&quot;
        (lpk) file for a web site. A suitable file is obtainable
        from Medical Connections, though if you wish to include
        other licensed controls on the same page, you will need
        to construct your own, as documented in Microsoft
        knowledge base article Q159923. Also as of version 4.0,
        a range of &quot;signed&quot; .cab files is available to
        allow auto-download of DicomObjects into PCs for use in
        Internet Explorer. Different versions are available for
        Internet/Intranet use and differing security levels, so
        please ask for details.</p>
