DataPointDescr_1=System Cache Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code in the file system cache. This value includes only current physical pages and does not include any virtual memory pages not currently resident. It does equal the System Cache value shown in Task Manager. As a result, this value may be smaller than the actual amount of virtual memory in use by the file system cache. This value is a component of Memory\System Code Resident Bytes which represents all pageable operating system code that is currently in physical memory. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
