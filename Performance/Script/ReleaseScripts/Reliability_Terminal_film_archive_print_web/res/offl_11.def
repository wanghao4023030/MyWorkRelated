DataPointDescr_1=Processor Queue Length is the instantaneous length of the processor queue in units of threads.  This counter is always 0 unless you are also monitoring a thread counter.  All processors use a single queue in which threads wait for processor cycles.  This length does not include the threads that are currently executing.  A sustained processor queue length greater than two generally indicates processor congestion.  This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.
