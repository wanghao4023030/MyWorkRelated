DataPointDescr_1=Page Faults/sec is a count of the Page Faults in the processor.  A page fault occurs when a process refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its Working Set in main memory.  A Page Fault will not cause the page to be fetched from disk if that page is on the standby list, and hence already in main memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is shared.
